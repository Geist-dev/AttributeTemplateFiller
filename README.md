# Attribute Templates & Autofill

Attribute Templates & Autofill is a QGIS plugin that allows you to create reusable attribute presets and automatically apply them when digitizing new vector features.

It significantly speeds up repetitive data entry workflows and ensures consistent attribute values across your GIS projects.

## ✨ Features

- Create multiple attribute templates per layer
- Automatically apply active template when adding new features
- Safely ignores primary key fields (prevents UNIQUE constraint errors)
- Apply templates to selected features
- Import and export templates (JSON format)
- Multilingual interface
- Compatible with QGIS 3.16+

## 🚀 Why use this plugin?

When digitizing large datasets, many attributes repeat with only minor differences.

Instead of manually filling the same fields over and over again, you can:

1. Create a template once
2. Activate it
3. Digitize features with attributes filled automatically

This improves productivity and reduces human errors.
